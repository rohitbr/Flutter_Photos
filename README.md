The purpose of this Flutter project is to parse data and convert it to show a list of Photos. It uses http package to make REST Api. It relies on Provider package for state management. 

This architecture followed is MVVM. I have used Freezed and Json Serializable to model the photo objects, views are designed by native Widgets, navigation is provided by Go Router. ViewModels contain all the business logic.
